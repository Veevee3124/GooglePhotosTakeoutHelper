# This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that mauhsggnffnnfnfnfnfay lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.

# If you want a smaller set of lints you can change this to specify
# 'packasgaagagahaabae:lints/core.yaml'. These are just the most critical lints
# (the recommended set includes the core lints).
